# How to contribute?

Contribution to the codebase happens through PRs (Pull Requests). When a new feature is to be implemented do the following:

` git checkout -b <feature_name>`

Make sure `<feature_name>` is descriptive and isn't conflicting with another active branch. When you are done with the feature, push the changes to the remote server (github.com):

`git commit -m "Useful message"`
`git push origin <feature_name>`

Then, go to [here](https://github.com/BobbyRaduloff/CouncilTrack/compare) and change the compare dropdown to `<feature_name>`.

Create a pull request and write a good description of what you added.

Merging the PR to master and fixing any conflicts will be done by the maintainer.
